# Microsoft Graph API Cmdlets
## Features
These cmdlets are meant to give administrators an easy way to interact with
 the Microsoft Graph API. The hope is to have the most popular features of
  MS Graph here as cmdlets.

Install the module from the PowerShell gallery with the command:
`Install-Module MSGraphAPI`

### Current Functions
1. Authenticate to Microsot Graph with Get-GraphAuthenticationToken
2. Run graph methods with Invoke-GraphMethod
3. Get / Create / Remove Azure AD users
4. Manage Intune apps
5. Manage Intune device categories


## To Do
This is project is still new so there is a lot to do! I'm focusing first on adding Intune features.
